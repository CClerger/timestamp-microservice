## API project 1 from FreeCodeCamp

Features:
* Convert from unix timestamp to natural language date and vice-versa.
* You can pass as a parameter a unix timestamp (https://cclerger-timestamp-microserv.glitch.me/1450137600) or a natural language date (https://cclerger-timestamp-microserv.glitch.me/December%2015,%202015) and the app will return a JSON with both information.
* Will return 'null' for both fields if the parameter is something else.
